  I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.tru.ca/">Thompson Rivers University</a>, and graduating soon (December 2025)! I've been (on and off) programming since 2018, ever since I decided to pursue a career in the technology field. I love learning. Which is why I try to keep up with making projects, learning new technologies, languages, and much more ðŸ˜„. I've had multiple experiences that can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gkangshim/">LinkedIn</a>. I love everything technology related: Web Development, IT, Software Development, etc.
